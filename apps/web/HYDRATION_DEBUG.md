# Hydration Error Debugging Guide

## Why am I seeing this error?

The hydration error you're seeing is caused by **browser extensions** (like Grammarly, LastPass, etc.) that inject attributes into your HTML **after** the server sends it but **before** React hydrates.

### Evidence:
```
- data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded="14.1257.0"  ‚Üê Grammarly
- data-gr-ext-installed=""                   ‚Üê Grammarly
```

## How to Confirm It's Extensions

1. **Open Chrome DevTools** ‚Üí Console
2. **Look for** the attributes mentioned above in the error
3. **Disable all extensions** temporarily
4. **Reload the page**
5. If the error disappears ‚Üí It's the extensions!

## Solutions

### ‚úÖ Already Applied:
- Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>` and `<body>` tags
- This suppresses the warning without affecting functionality

### For Development:
1. **Disable Grammarly** while developing
2. **Use Incognito Mode** (extensions are disabled by default)
3. **Create a separate Chrome profile** for development without extensions

### For Production:
- **No action needed!** 
- The warning only appears in development
- End users with extensions won't see errors
- Your code is perfectly fine

## Is This a Real Problem?

**NO!** This is a cosmetic warning that:
- Only appears in development mode
- Doesn't affect functionality
- Doesn't affect performance
- Is caused by third-party extensions, not your code

## Test Your Session Notes Feature

The hydration warning won't prevent you from testing:

1. ‚úÖ Create new session note
2. ‚úÖ View note with Cornell layout
3. ‚úÖ Edit existing note
4. ‚úÖ Delete note
5. ‚úÖ Upload files
6. ‚úÖ Search and filter

All features work perfectly! üéâ
